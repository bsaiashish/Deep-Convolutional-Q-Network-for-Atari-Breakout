# Deep-Convolutional-Q-Network-for-Atari-Breakout
A reimplementation of the famous Google DeepMind paper on Deep Reinforcement Learning
mensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The
model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning,
whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future
rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 260
